STO-3g Basis function  -
------------------------

The STO-3G basis is a very well-known minimal basis set which contracts 3 Gaussian functions to approximate the more accurate (but more difficult to compute) Slater type orbitals.

# Builds a STO-3G basis that aproximates a single slater type orbital  with Slater orbital exponent zeta
function STO3G(center, zeta)
  scaling = zeta^2
